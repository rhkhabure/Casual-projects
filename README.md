# Obesity Data analysis
Obesity is a serious and chronic disease with genetic and environmental interactions. It is defined as an excessive amount of fat tissue in the body that is harmful to health. The main risk factors for obesity include social, psychological, and eating habits. Obesity is a significant health problem for all age groups in the world. Currently, more than 2 billion people worldwide are obese or overweight. Research has shown that obesity can be prevented. In this study, artificial intelligence methods were used to identify individuals at risk of obesity. An online survey was conducted on 1610 individuals to create the obesity dataset. To analyze the survey data, four commonly used artificial intelligence methods in the literature, namely Artificial Neural Network, K Nearest Neighbors, Random Forest and Support Vector Machine, were employed after pre-processing. As a result of this analysis, obesity classes were predicted correctly with success rates of 74.96%, 74.03%, 74.03% and 87.82%, respectively. Random Forest was the most successful artificial intelligence method for this dataset and accurately classified obesity with a success rate of 87.82%.
The source of data is from the Kaggle website((Learn Python, Data Viz, Pandas & More | Tutorials | Kaggle, n.d.)).With the provided CSV file and its documentation of the different columns and what each variable number means.
